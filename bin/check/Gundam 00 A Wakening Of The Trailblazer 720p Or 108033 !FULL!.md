The movie is not without its flaws, however. The plot is complex and confusing, with many characters and factions that are hard to keep track of. The movie also deviates from the realistic and political tone of the series, and introduces a more fantastical and metaphysical element that may not appeal to some fans. The movie also has a very open-ended conclusion, which leaves many questions unanswered.
 
Overall, Gundam 00 - A Wakening of the Trailblazer is a must-watch for fans of the series, as it provides a satisfying conclusion to the characters' arcs and themes. The movie is also a feast for the eyes, with breathtaking animation and sound design that will immerse you in the Gundam universe. Whether you choose to watch it in 720p or 1080p, you will not be disappointed by this movie.
  
The movie also features a stellar soundtrack, composed by Kenji Kawai, who also worked on the series. The soundtrack blends orchestral, electronic, and ethnic music, creating a diverse and atmospheric score that matches the mood and setting of the movie. The movie also has two theme songs, "Tozasareta Sekai" by The Back Horn, and "Qualia" by Uverworld, both of which are catchy and emotional.
