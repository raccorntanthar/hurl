In this article, we will show you how to use IAR EWARM 6.5 for ARM development. We will cover the following topics:
 
- How to install and configure IAR EWARM 6.5
- How to create and build a simple project
- How to debug and test your code
- How to store a const variable in a certain address

## How to Install and Configure IAR EWARM 6.5
 
To install IAR EWARM 6.5, you need to download the installer from the official website[^3^]. You can choose either the full edition or the evaluation edition. The full edition requires a license key, while the evaluation edition has a 14-day time limitation with no state limit.
 
After downloading the installer, run it and follow the instructions on the screen. You can choose the default settings or customize them according to your preferences. The installation process may take some time depending on your system configuration.
 
Once the installation is complete, you can launch IAR EWARM 6.5 from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see the main window of the IDE, which consists of several panes and toolbars. You can adjust the layout and appearance of the IDE by using the View menu or dragging and dropping the panes.
  
## How to Create and Build a Simple Project
 
To create a new project in IAR EWARM 6.5, you need to select File > New > Workspace from the menu bar. A workspace is a container for one or more projects that share common settings and resources. You can name your workspace and choose a location to save it.
 
Next, you need to add a new project to your workspace by selecting Project > Create New Project from the menu bar. A project is a collection of source files, header files, libraries, and other files that are compiled and linked together to produce an executable file.
 
You can choose from various project templates based on your target device and application type. For example, you can choose an empty project, a blinky project, or a C/C++ project. You can also import an existing project from another IDE or toolchain.
 
After choosing a project template, you need to specify the name and location of your project. You also need to select your target device from a list of supported devices[^1^]. You can use the search feature by clicking Ctrl + F to find your device quickly.
